            There are movements across social media and the wider web to encourage including descriptions for images posted
            so that Visually Impaired people, along with many others, can have access to posts and join the conversation. 
            For many this is difficult for a wide variety of reasons. We're setting out to build tools to make it easier. 
            We've built multiple proofs of concept and prototypes, now we're working to build a tool for release to use on
            every platform we can.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for a shared library of alt text has been around since the <code>alt</code> attribute was added to the
            HTML specification. It's only recently that the technology available to the public has caught up. We're starting
            with private libraries, but hope to help people share descriptions for popular images in the future, including
            services for direct access via screenreader.
        </p>

            We're a small team right now and hoping for more help in the future, but right now our needs are help with UI/UX
            design and especially consultation or help from Visually Impaired folks on our path forward. We are currently
            without funding, but will pay for that help as soon as we are able.
