    <p><b>Alt Text Everywhere. Never For Profit.</b></p>
    <p>
        What if descriptions of popular images, written by a human, were available to anyone who needed them? What if
        folks could sign up to effortlessly contribute the alt text they write on social media? What if they could come
        across posts without it and add a description for the world with a right click? We believe these are all
        possible, and we'd like to make them real.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea for a shared library of alt text has been around since the alt attribute was added to the HTML
        specification. It's only recently that the technology available to the public has caught up. The project as it
        stands is a successful proof of concept. The next steps will take some work.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've assembled an incredible team from across the world to build the foundation for this project. The next
        steps are finding funding and building a community. We're working hard on both.
