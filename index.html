    </header>

    <p><b>Designed to help people share the alt text they write.</b></p>

    <h3>We're Working On A Roadmap. We'll be looking for a variety of help soon.</h3>
    <p>
        The idea for a library of alt text has been around since the alt tag was added to the HTML specification. It's
        only recently that the technology available to the public has caught up. The project as it stands is a
        successful proof of concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        What if descriptions of popular images, written by a human, were available to anyone who needed them? What if
        folks could sign up to effortlessly contribute the alt text they write on social media? What if they could come
        across posts without it and add a description for the world with a right click? I believe these are all
        possible, and I'd like to make them real. The project as it stands can support these things on a technical
        level, but the challenges at hand are going to take a community effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original author put the project down because the next steps were beyond her, but after some time away the
        community has stepped up. We'll have additional announcements soon.
