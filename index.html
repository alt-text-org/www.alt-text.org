        What if descriptions of popular images, written by a human, were available to anyone who needed them? What if
        folks could sign up to effortlessly contribute the alt text they write on social media? What if they could come
        across posts without it and add a description for the world with a right click? We believe these are all
        possible, and we'd like to make them real.

        The idea for a shared library of alt text has been around since the <code>alt</code> attribute was added to the
        HTML specification. It's only recently that the technology available to the public has caught up. The project
        as it stands is a successful proof of concept. Building the library as we build a non-profit around it is the
        next challenge.
    </p>

        We've assembled an incredible team from across the world to build the foundation for this project. Watch this
